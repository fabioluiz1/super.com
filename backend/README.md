## Web Server Coding (90 minutes)

In this session, you'll build a simple endpoint that interacts with a database.

Please ensure your development environment is set up in advance.
You may use Python or Node.js, with a backend framework and a database of your choice (relational or non-relational).
Use tools you're comfortable with to optimize your performance.
Attached to this email is an overview of how we approach AI at Super.com. It should give you a clear sense of our expectations, as well as how we think about the space and its practical use within our organization heading into the interviews. Please note that we expect you to share any program that you are actively using in the interview, whether it be AI/Postman/Google etc.

See [docs/Super.com-AIinInterviews.pdf](docs/Super.com-AIinInterviews.pdf) for the AI policy.
