## Frontend Pair Programming (45 minutes)

In this session, you'll create a simple web app that involves ingesting, manipulating, and displaying data.

Please set up a React boilerplate in advance (e.g., using Create React App). If you're more comfortable with another modern frontend framework like Vue or Angular, feel free to use that instead.
You'll be expected to share your screen and work through the problem collaboratively.
To keep things simple, we recommend avoiding unnecessary complexity such as unfamiliar libraries or type systems.

# Super.com Frontend Interview Boilerplate

### NOTE: More details will be given during the interview, this is just a boilerplate to get you started.
But in the meantime, feel free to install any additional FE tooling (ie MaterialUI, Tailwind, ReactQuery) that you'd like! We'll be doing some API requests & styling mainly, no web-page routing.

### Setup (Recommended to do before interview)

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Visit `http://localhost:5173/`
4. Make sure your changes are reflected in the browser when editing `App.tsx` for example
